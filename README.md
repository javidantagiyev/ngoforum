1. clock time

   1.1. It is useless to have a clock and date on the website since everyone uses mobile phones or computers that already has this function. <br>
   1.2. There is no logo on the page <br>
   I think there must be a logo on the header <br>
   1.3. Title Logo and Name can be cooler. <br><img height="50" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2be0ddac-0a92-44e3-9337-233e4656ecd6" /> <br>
   
3. dark mode: <br>
   2.1. There is no dark mode transition. It may look cooler if there is a transition between white mode and dark mode <br>
   2.2. Dark mode is too dark in hex #000000 (black) (not whole body but in every division) - it makes my eyes tired, it would be more convenient and good-looking if it were gray or some specific color like #0d1117 <br>
   2.3. When I change to dark mode on the "Müraciət Forması" page, and then I go to other pages, this automatically changes to white mode. It should not be like that; it should dynamically be dark mode everywhere. <br>

4. text issues: <br>
  3.1. There is an issue like <br><img height="50" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/949b7f33-f227-4f29-84d4-a2ae45d60b5b" /> <br>
      It says "1 il ago" instead of "1 il öncə"<br>

5. Əsas Səhifə:<br>
  4.1. I think there is too much information on the main page, and most of them are the same post (I see one post almost everywhere)<br>

6. Footer:<br>
  5.1. The footer also has too much information. I think I see those posts on the main page, there is no need to have them on the footer<br>
  5.2. "Son Əlavə Olunanlar" and "Popular Xəbərlər" are literally the same in terms of posts and their order. <br>
  5.3 <br><img height="50" alt="{42906B3F-333A-49B6-8511-3B8E362027E2}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6d93201-7f61-4e38-9496-5128c2f135b2" /> <br>
  I think this footer spoils the formal reputation.


7. "About" Page:<br>
   6.1. About Page has too little information without any visualization. I think we can add some data (charts, forecasts, etc.) and more information, and some pictures there that people can get direct information about our jobs and what we do without going through all the posts on the page.<br>

8. "Bizimlə Əlaqə" <br>
  7.1. I think this page should not be separated; it should be on the footer that everyone can easily see.<br>
